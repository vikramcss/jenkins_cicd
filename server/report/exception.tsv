Dr. Mahadev Bhagwan Kadam  kmahadeo2003@gmail.com 9075199942 age: 41 years  exceptionalCandidate:Yes reason: Respected Sir/Madam, I request you to consider me as an exceptional candidate for relaxation in age because I am experienced in a wide variety of materials synthesis and characterization techniques. During Ph.D. and Postoc, I received training in various areas of materials applications including superconductivity and Fuel cells and handled highly sophisticated equipments. Few of my research publications are in a journal with an impact factor greater than 5.  I wish to utilize my experience in the development materials and products. Few points about my research experience are highlighted below. I did Ph.D. in Physics (Superconductivity). My research interests are Superconductivity, Magnetism, Quantum Computers and Quantum phenomenonâ€™s at low temperatures, MEMS, NEMS and energy conversion and storage devices especially Fuel Cells and Supercapacitors. I did postdoc in Technion-IIT Israel (Quantum Engineering), UJ South Africa (Magnetism) and Chonnam University South Korea (Photonic materials). I am experienced in Materials Science and received hands-on experience in materials synthesis in thin film form using electrochemical synthesis techniques, Sputtering, Vacuum evaporation, Atomic layer deposition (ALD) etc and Bulk form using soild state method and combustion synthesis etc. I am experienced in wide variety of characterization techniques and also handled materials characterization setups XRD, SEM, Four probe Resistivity setups at Low temperatures (Liquid Nitrogen and Helium temperatures), Microwave Vector Network analyzers, Impedance Analyzers, TGA-DTA setup, UV-Vis-IR Spectrophotometer, Spectroscopic Ellipsometry etc. I am experienced in Nanofabrication, worked in Class 100 cleanrooms, used Photolithography (Mask Aligners) and E-beam lithography setups, handled sophisticated instruments such as Focused Ion beam (FIB) to develop Josephson Junctions and SQUIDs, handled Low temperature systems including dilution refrigerators, Microwave characterization (Vector Network analyzer), Low temperature thermal expansion measurement setups  etc. I am experienced in synthesis of materials for fuel cells, handled potentiostat for electrodeposition deposition and characterization of thin films, Analyzed fuel cell materials for impedance behavior. I wish to utilize my experience in developing materials for quantum computers, superconducting Qubits, Quantum computers and NEMS to observe Quantum phenomenon. Also I want to develop solid oxide fuel cells and supercapacitors.

GUJAR TANAJI PRALAD gujartp@gmail.com 9284941153 age: 43 years  exceptionalCandidate:Yes reason: My research experience of 12 years has prepared me to be an effective researcher and instructor suitable in your department at C-MET. My doctoral dissertation was conducted in consultation with Prof. C.D.Lokhande at Shivaji University, Kolhapur, and examines the use of a relatively new material BiFeO3 prepared by electrochemical method for Supercapacitor application. Electrochemically synthesized nanocrystalline pervoskite BiFeO3 electrode was presented as an efficient potential candidate in supercapacitor application. For the first time we explored electrochemically deposited Bi2O3 for application in supercapacitors. As a part of my thesis work I carried out research on Electrosynthesis of Bi2O3, Fe2O3, BiFeO3 and their application in electrochemical supercapacitors. Apart from thesis work, I have prepared other metal oxide thin films like Co3O4 CdO, ZnO, TiO2 and RuO2 by electrochemical and chemical methods and their use in Supercapacitor, Photoelectrochemical cell, electrochromism and Dye sensitized solar cell. During my postdoctoral research in Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), South Korea, I worked on synthesis CuInSe2 films via electrochemical route for compound solar cell applications. Moreover, I have demonstrated an electrochemical approach for selenization of CuInSe2 films which is environment friendly. During my tenure at National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Japan I focused on mesoporous wide band gap oxides for dye sensitized solar cells. I could achieve significant value of DSSC efficiency using the concepts of 1D nanowires, light scattering, surface site engineering etc. Further in Germany I worked on Perovskite solar cells and achieved highly Reproducible and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells with Extraordinary Stability. I have got good experience on synthesis of binary and ternary semiconductor oxides and chalcogenide nanostructure by various methods. Besides chemical methods for thin films, I have also worked on thermal evaporation and reactive sputtering.  I have presented my research work at various national and International conferences and got the appreciation from scientists. As well as my papers found a wide acceptance worldwide, as can be seen from the citation index of Scholar with citation over 4000 and h factor 36. I am excited to share and continue to explore this methodology and collaborate with your department faculty to expand its potential. I found that my professional experience as a researcher  provided me with a broad view that is useful in assisting students with projects and assignments. These experiences have built my confidence and an interest in teaching and I look forward to the opportunity to explore the new research opportunity at C-MET.
